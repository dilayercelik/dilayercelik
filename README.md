# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Second-Year undergraduate student at University College London ([UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)), doing an MSci (Integrated Master of Science) in Psychology and Language Sciences at the Faculty of Brain Sciences (2019-2023); also the Media Officer of the [UCL Neuroscience Society](http://www.uclneurosoc.com/) (2020-2021).

ðŸ§  During my first year of university, I came to realise that I wanted to (& could) satisfy my long-standing curiosity in Artifical Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning); I also started to develop an interest in neuroscience.

ðŸ“š I'm currently exploring these fields, both in class and on my own: ultimately, I aspire to legitimately combine my interests in ML and neuroscience in a postgraduate programme in the future (Master's): I'm particularly interested in computational/cognitive neuroscience.  

ðŸ–¥ I'm open to all opportunities, and always interested in discussing topics I'm curious about with others!
