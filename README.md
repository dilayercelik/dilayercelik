# Hi there, I'm Dilay ðŸ‘‹


I'm a First-Year undergraduate student at University College London (UCL), doing an MSci (Integrated Master of Science) in Psychology and Language Sciences at the Faculty of Brain Sciences; also the Media Officer of the UCL Neuroscience Society (2020-2021).

ðŸ§  During my first year of university, I came to realise that I wanted to satisfy my curiosity in Artifical Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning) and started growing an interest in neuroscience.

ðŸ“š I'm currently exploring these fields, both in class and on my own: ultimately, I aspire to legitimately combine my interests in ML and neuroscience in a postgraduate programme in the future (Master's): I'm particularly interested in computational/cognitive neuroscience.  

ðŸ–¥ I'm open to all opportunities, and always am interested in discussing topics I'm curious about with others! 


# Current Highlights

I enjoy learning and extending my knowledge in all sorts of things, and have recently picked up reading again âœ¨
- ðŸ‘‰ current book I'm reading: Little Women by Louisa May Alcott
